This is my first assignment I made with "Jest" A library for Test Driven Development (Javascript) from NPM. In this assignment we are going to write code for a vegetable garden. Where we are increasingly implementing a little more functionality

#### Assignment: TDD Vegetable-Garden


## Terminology and vegetable formulas
But first back to the plants. We grow fruit and vegetables in a garden. We are going to calculate how much yield the various fruits and vegetables have for the garden. We will also take into account environmental factors such as sun, wind and temperature. These environmental factors influence how many kilos of fruit and vegetables grow on the plants. Finally, we will calculate how much profit we can make with our vegetable garden.

## First, let's explain some English terms and definitions:

>- "crop" is a collection of plants of the same species, eg a field of maize
>- "costs" are the costs of sowing one plant
>- "yield" is the yield of one plant or one crop (in kilos)
>- "sale price" is the selling price of a type of fruit or vegetable per kilo
>- "revenue" is the turnover or income of one kilogram of fruit or vegetables
>- "profits" is profit, so that is revenue - costs
>- "factor" in this context is an environmental factor that influences the yield
